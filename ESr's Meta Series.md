## Seven generations

**ESr's Meta Series** of articles 
is dedicated to
those who will be born
***seven generations*** from now,
2026 in the Era of Christ.

The Series is also a spell
to end the Era.

...

**ESr Meta Series** contains 
my explanations for 
the limits of Western analytical thinking
that has led us to **SOET**.

Self-Induced Omnicidal Existential Threats:

*  Climate change.
*  Nuclear arms.
*  Synthetic intelligence.

We are sitting on 
an eco-social pressure bomb
of our own construction.

***Why?*** 

## Contents

ESr's Meta Series 
begins with four articles:

1.  The Birth of Metaology
2.  Provenance Perspective Theory
3.  Meta Set Theory
4.  Intrinsic Fourier Decomposition

These four articles provides 
a framework to understand 
the epistemic foundations of our SOET
at the most abstract level:
theories in Mathematics and physics.

## Format

The Series presents
what I call ***transmission** articles*,
designed to convey ideas
as simply and clearly as possible.

They are not academic journal articles ,
but are intended to inspired them.

The Series utilizes 
***dialogs*** with chatbots (aka LLMs)
in these articles for two functions:

1.  **Translators** that re-express 
    my idiosyncratic language
    into human readable form.
2.  **Foils** that provide 
    standard Western perspectives
    with which to contrast mine.

As the dialogs show,
all substantive ideas
generated by me, ESr,
and not the LLMs.

In fact,
the LLMs can be rather ***verbose***.
My suggestion is:

*  Feel free to ***skim*** LLM responses.
*  Focus on my prompts.
   That's where all the ***action*** is.

LLM's responses are relatively predictable.
My prompts, not so much.
