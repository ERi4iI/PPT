## Format

These papers are intended as ***transmission** articles*<br>
for conveying novel foundational concepts<br>
to those who're hungry & ready for new perspectives<br>
on the epistemic limits of objective science.

These papers are not journal articles<br>
but are intended to inspire them.

## Goal 

I am an independent researcher<br>
without institutional affiliation.

I am seeking **co-authors** interested in<br>
transforming these papers for journal publications.
