I am an independent researcher<br>
who recently developed PPT<br>
in an effort to formalize<br>
Bohr’s Principle of Complementarity.<br>

This paper is intended to allow<br> 
someone with requisite expertise<br>
in Mathematics foundations<br> 
to evaluate PPT.<br>

Should PPT be deemed worthy,<br>
I seek **co-authors**<br> 
who wish to collaborate<br>
in publishing the concept.<br>
